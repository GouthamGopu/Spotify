# Spotify ðŸŽµ

This project is a static clone of the **Spotify** interface, created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes a limited selection of 10 songs stored locally, allowing basic music playback. While the site is currently static, there is potential to upgrade it by integrating a database to dynamically fetch and manage songs.

## Features

- **Static Song List**: Includes 10 locally stored songs for playback.
- **Basic Music Player**: Allows users to play/pause music, skip tracks, and adjust volume.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: Mimics the clean and modern interface of Spotify.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS** - For styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** - Adds interactivity and manages music playback using local storage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
